- Created Kubernetes manifests for production deployment
- Created a deployment script (deploy.sh) for managing deployments

### Data Collection Services
- **Data Crawler Service**:
  - Created Dockerfile, package.json, and basic implementation
  - Implemented models for crawl jobs and results
  - Implemented service for web crawling operations
  - Implemented API routes for managing crawl jobs
  - Added health check endpoints

- **Data Scraper Service**:
  - Created Dockerfile, requirements.txt, and basic implementation
  - Implemented models for scrape jobs and results
  - Implemented service for web scraping operations
  - Implemented API routes for managing scrape jobs
  - Added health check endpoints

### Data Processing Services
- **Data Preprocessor Service**:
  - Created Dockerfile, requirements.txt, and basic implementation
  - Implemented models for preprocessing jobs and results
  - Implemented database service for MongoDB operations
  - Implemented storage service for MinIO operations
  - Added health check endpoints
