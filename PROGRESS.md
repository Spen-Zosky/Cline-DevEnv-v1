  - Created Dockerfile, requirements.txt, and basic implementation
  - Implemented models for preprocessing jobs and results
  - Implemented database service for MongoDB operations
  - Implemented storage service for MinIO operations
  - Added health check endpoints

### API Gateway
- Created Dockerfile, package.json, and basic implementation
- Implemented Express.js application with middleware for security, logging, and rate limiting
- Implemented health check endpoints for monitoring service status
- Implemented service routes for managing platform services
- Implemented system routes for monitoring and managing the system
- Added proxy middleware to route requests to appropriate services
- Added Swagger documentation for API endpoints

### Research Dashboard
- Created Dockerfile, package.json, and basic implementation
- Implemented React application with TypeScript and Material UI
- Created main layout with responsive sidebar navigation
- Implemented Dashboard page with system overview and service status
- Implemented Services page for managing and monitoring services
- Implemented System Monitor page with detailed metrics and logs
- Added NotFound page for handling 404 errors
- Created API service for communicating with the API Gateway
- Added Nginx configuration for serving the application and proxying API requests
